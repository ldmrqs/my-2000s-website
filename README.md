# Retro PC Interactive Resume - Windows XP Emulation

Welcome to my interactive resume project! This is a retro-inspired portfolio site that emulates a classic **Windows XP** PC. It’s not just a creative way to present my work, but also a tribute to the technology of the early 2000s, designed to capture the nostalgia of my first experiences with computers.

## **Why Retro?**

- **Personal Connection**: This project reflects my love for the aesthetics of the early 2000s. The look and feel are inspired by the first PC I used — an old, beige, tube monitor. It’s where I spent hours playing games, chatting on MSN, browsing Orkut, and listening to music. This site is a tribute to those moments.
  
- **Band Tribute**: The wallpaper featured in the project is dedicated to one of my favorite bands, which has been a huge part of my life since childhood.

- **The First OS**: The design and feel of the site pay homage to **Windows XP**, the first operating system I ever used. It's my way of honoring that era of computing.

## **Project Concept**

- **Minimalist Design**: I've kept the design simple yet nostalgic, featuring only three classic programs — **Internet Explorer**, **Notepad**, and **Recycle Bin**. The simplicity adds to the retro aesthetic, evoking the look and functionality of old-school desktops.

- **Future Features**: While the taskbar won’t be interactive for now, I’m considering adding interactivity to it in the future as I continue to develop the project.

## **How It Works**

- **Interactive Experience**: Clicking on **Internet Explorer** takes you to my resume presented in a fun, retro-inspired style, reminiscent of the early web. It’s a straightforward, nostalgic browsing experience showcasing my professional journey, education, and contact information.

- **Notepad Plans**: I have future plans for **Notepad** to incorporate some interactive features, but this will come after the foundational design is completed.
